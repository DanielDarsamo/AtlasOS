Atlas OS — UX Flow Mapping
This document outlines the UX flows and screen logic for Atlas OS. It serves as a blueprint for building the interface and mapping user interactions before creating Figma designs.

1. Core Principles
    1 Behavior-first: Prioritize user actions and execution visibility.
    2 Minimal friction: Reduce steps to log habits or view progress.
    3 Adaptive feedback: Show real-time progress, streaks, and recovery suggestions.
    4 AI-guided assistance: Contextual AI recommendations integrated seamlessly.
    5 Scalability: Supports any user goal domain and habit type.

2. Screen Flows
2.1 Onboarding & Profile Setup
Screens:
    1 Welcome / Introduction
    2 User Registration / Login
    3 User Profile Setup:
        ◦ Name, gender, age range
        ◦ Focus area (career, health, study, personal, custom)
        ◦ Daily time budget & energy pattern
        ◦ Difficulty preference
    4 Goal Setup:
        ◦ Primary goal input
        ◦ Milestones & high-level roadmap
Logic:
    • After registration, prompt for profile setup
    • Validate required fields
    • AI suggests initial step breakdown for first goal
    • Redirect to dashboard

2.2 Dashboard / Home Screen
Screens:
    1 Overview of today’s habits & goals
    2 Execution Score / Daily DES
    3 Streak overview
    4 Quick actions: Log habit, mark recovery, view AI suggestions
    5 Notifications / alerts (missed habit, overload, recovery recommendation)
Logic:
    • Pull execution_logs and execution_scores for the day
    • Highlight habits due today with priority indicators
    • Show AI-suggested steps inline
    • Click on habit → log completion or mark as missed
    • Click on score → show trend graph & streak breakdown

2.3 Goal & Habit Management
Screens:
    1 List of Goals (filterable by domain, status)
    2 Goal Detail:
        ◦ Description, milestones, progress bar
        ◦ Linked habits
        ◦ AI step suggestions
    3 Habit Detail:
        ◦ Frequency, difficulty, execution history
        ◦ Option to adjust or archive habit
Logic:
    • CRUD for goals and habits
    • Link/unlink habits to goals
    • AI suggestions can be applied or ignored
    • Milestone completion auto-updates goal progress

2.4 Execution Logging Flow
Screens:
    1 Habit List for Today
    2 Log Completion Screen
    3 Optional: Add notes or context tag (normal, bad_day, recovery)
Logic:
    • Select habit → mark complete/incomplete
    • If missed, system triggers recovery suggestion
    • Update execution_logs immutably
    • Recompute execution_scores and streaks

2.5 Analytics & Insights
Screens:
    1 Daily Execution Score & trend graph
    2 Weekly Consistency Index (WCI)
    3 Habit completion trends (heatmap)
    4 AI Insights & Recommendations
    5 Overload alerts and recovery tracking
Logic:
    • Fetch historical execution data
    • Compute streaks, WCI, volatility
    • Highlight patterns of missed execution, recovery, or overload
    • AI provides actionable suggestions per insight

2.6 AI Planning & Guidance
Screens:
    1 AI Suggested Steps for Goal
    2 Quarterly Roadmap Preview
    3 Habit Reprioritization & Recovery Suggestions
Logic:
    • Show AI-generated steps as actionable cards
    • Allow user to accept, edit, or ignore each suggestion
    • Accepted steps automatically added to daily habits or milestone list
    • Track acceptance for AI learning

2.7 Notifications & Alerts
Screens:
    1 Missed Habit Alert
    2 Streak Break Notification
    3 Overload Warning
    4 Recovery Reminder
    5 AI Suggested Plan Update
Logic:
    • Triggered by event flows
    • Links directly to dashboard, habit logging, or AI suggestion screen
    • User can snooze, dismiss, or act immediately

2.8 Settings & Profile
Screens:
    1 Profile Settings (personal info, energy pattern, difficulty preference)
    2 Notification Preferences
    3 Goal & Habit Defaults
    4 AI Plan Preferences
    5 Data & Privacy
Logic:
    • All preferences reflected in AI recommendations and scheduling
    • Changes update backend in real-time

3. Flow Diagram (Text-Based)
Onboarding --> Dashboard --> [Daily Habits Logging]
                     |--> Goal & Habit Management --> Dashboard
                     |--> Analytics & Insights --> Dashboard
                     |--> AI Planning --> Dashboard
                     |--> Notifications & Alerts --> Dashboard
Settings --> Dashboard
This flow ensures centralized dashboard navigation with minimal friction, quick logging, AI guidance, and clear visibility into performance trends.

4. Notes
    • Every screen connects back to Dashboard for consistency.
    • AI-driven screens are optional; users can ignore suggestions.
    • Notifications are actionable, linking to relevant screens.
    • Execution data is always immutable; users can see history but cannot edit past logs.
This UX mapping serves as a foundation for wireframes, Figma, and eventual front-end implementation.
