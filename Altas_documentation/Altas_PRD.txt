Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Product Overview
Product Name (Working Title): Atlas OS
Product Type: Universal Goal Execution, Habit Tracking, and Personal Analytics Platform
Problem Statement:People of all backgrounds, genders, and life stages struggle with consistency, not ambition. Existing productivity and habit apps are either overly generic, rigid, or motivational without structure. They fail to adapt to individual goals, lifestyles, energy levels, and constraints.
Solution:Atlas OS is a universal, adaptive execution system designed for any user (male, female, any background) whose objective is to build consistency, execute goals, and develop disciplined habits. The platform combines structured planning, habit tracking, AI-assisted breakdowns, and behavioral analytics to guide users from intent to sustained action.
Atlas OS adapts to the user, not the other way around.

2. Target Users
Universal User Scope
Atlas OS is designed to accommodate any user, regardless of gender, background, profession, or life stage. The system adapts to the user, not the other way around.
Primary User Profiles
    • Individuals seeking consistency and discipline
    • Students managing academic goals
    • Professionals managing career, health, and personal growth

User Intent (Core)
    • Build consistency
    • Track and execute goals
    • Form and sustain habits

3. Core Value Proposition
    • Execution over motivation
    • Systems over willpower
    • Feedback over blind consistency
Atlas OS does not ask what you want to do. It shows what you actually do, why you fail, and how to correct it.
